# GRA Framework Enhancement Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the GRA framework.

## Implemented Features

### 1. API Versioning Package

- Created a versioning package with multiple versioning strategies:
  - Path versioning (e.g., /v1/resource)
  - Query parameter versioning (e.g., /resource?version=1)
  - Header versioning (e.g., Accept-Version: 1)
  - Media type versioning (e.g., Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json)
- Added configuration options:
  - Support for multiple API versions
  - Default version fallback
  - Strict/non-strict mode
  - Custom error handling
- Integrated with middleware system
- Added version info stored in context
- Added helper functions to retrieve version info

### 2. HTTP Response Cache Middleware

- Created cache package with an in-memory cache store
- Implemented HTTP response caching with ETag support
- Added cache control headers management
- Implemented validation for conditional GET requests
- Added configurable TTL and custom cache key generation
- Integrated with middleware system
- Added bypass options for dynamic content

### 3. JWT Authentication Package

- Created JWT package with token generation and validation
- Implemented secure JWT service with configurable options:
  - Multiple signing methods (HS256, RS256, etc.)
  - Configurable expiration times
  - Refresh token support
  - Custom claims support
- Added helper functions for common JWT operations
- Integrated with middleware system through Auth middleware
- Added protection against common JWT vulnerabilities

### 4. Secure Headers Middleware

- Implemented SecureHeaders middleware for improved security
- Added support for configuring multiple security headers:
  - X-XSS-Protection for cross-site scripting protection
  - X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME-type sniffing
  - X-Frame-Options to control framing of content
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS usage
  - Content-Security-Policy to restrict resource loading
  - Referrer-Policy to control referrer information
  - Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy to control resource sharing
- Added a modular design with separate functions for each header category
- Provided both default and custom configuration options

### 2. HTTP Response Caching

- Created a cache package with:
  - In-memory cache store implementation
  - Configurable TTL
  - ETag and conditional GET support
  - Cache key generation
  - Skip cache conditions
  - Cache control headers (Last-Modified, ETag)
  - Response capturing
  - Hop-by-hop header handling
  - Cache invalidation functions
- Integrated with middleware system

### 3. Documentation

- Updated README.md with documentation for:
  - API versioning features and usage examples
  - Response caching features and usage examples
- Created example application demonstrating:
  - API versioning implementation
  - Response caching implementation
  - Different response schemas per version

### 4. Tests

- Created unit tests for versioning package
- Created unit tests for cache package

## Future Work

1. **Enhance JWT functionality** - Add token revocation, blacklisting capabilities, and support for more complex authentication flows like refresh token rotation.

2. **Add rate limiting middleware** - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to protect against brute force and DoS attacks.

3. **Expand security headers** - Add support for additional security headers and automatic configuration based on environment (dev/prod).

4. **Add more cache stores** - Implement additional cache store backends like Redis or file-based for distributed applications.

5. **Extend versioning strategies** - Add more specialized versioning strategies based on user feedback.

6. **Add automated security testing** - Implement security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to catch potential vulnerabilities.

7. **Add benchmarks** - Create benchmark tests to measure the performance of middleware components.

8. **Create more comprehensive examples** - Develop more examples showing different integration patterns and use cases.
