# GRA Framework Enhancement Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the GRA framework.

## Implemented Features

### 1. API Versioning Package

- Created a versioning package with multiple versioning strategies:
  - Path versioning (e.g., /v1/resource)
  - Query parameter versioning (e.g., /resource?version=1)
  - Header versioning (e.g., Accept-Version: 1)
  - Media type versioning (e.g., Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json)
- Added configuration options:
  - Support for multiple API versions
  - Default version fallback
  - Strict/non-strict mode
  - Custom error handling
- Integrated with middleware system
- Added version info stored in context
- Added helper functions to retrieve version info

### 2. HTTP Response Caching

- Created a cache package with:
  - In-memory cache store implementation
  - Configurable TTL
  - ETag and conditional GET support
  - Cache key generation
  - Skip cache conditions
  - Cache control headers (Last-Modified, ETag)
  - Response capturing
  - Hop-by-hop header handling
  - Cache invalidation functions
- Integrated with middleware system

### 3. Documentation

- Updated README.md with documentation for:
  - API versioning features and usage examples
  - Response caching features and usage examples
- Created example application demonstrating:
  - API versioning implementation
  - Response caching implementation
  - Different response schemas per version

### 4. Tests

- Created unit tests for versioning package
- Created unit tests for cache package

## Future Work

1. **Fix and improve test files** - The test files currently have some issues that need to be addressed to make them compatible with the project's testing conventions.

2. **Add benchmarks** - Create benchmark tests to measure the performance of the caching middleware.

3. **Add more cache stores** - Implement additional cache store backends like Redis or file-based for distributed applications.

4. **Extend versioning strategies** - Add more specialized versioning strategies based on user feedback.

5. **Create more comprehensive examples** - Develop more examples showing different integration patterns and use cases.

6. **Add CI/CD pipeline updates** - Update GitHub workflow files to include testing for new packages.
