# JWT and Security Implementation Summary

This document provides details about the JWT and secure headers middleware implementation added in GRA Framework v1.0.4.

## JWT Authentication Package

The JWT (JSON Web Tokens) package provides authentication functionality for GRA applications with the following features:

### 1. Core Functionality
- Token generation with customizable claims
- Token validation and verification
- Token refreshing
- Support for standard and custom claims

### 2. Configuration Options
- Configurable signing methods (HS256, RS256, etc.)
- Adjustable token expiration times
- Custom issuer support
- Refresh token duration settings

### 3. Security Features
- Protection against common JWT vulnerabilities
- Proper error handling for token validation failures
- Support for token revocation strategies

### 4. Integration with Middleware
- Easy integration with GRA middleware system
- Automatic extraction of claims from tokens
- Support for role-based access control

## Secure Headers Middleware

The secure headers middleware enhances the security of GRA applications by adding various security-related HTTP headers.

### 1. Supported Security Headers
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Prevents reflected cross-site scripting attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Controls whether a page can be displayed in a frame
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces clients to use HTTPS
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls what referrer information should be included
- **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy**: Controls cross-origin resource sharing
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy**: Controls embedding of cross-origin resources
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy**: Controls window.opener behavior

### 2. Implementation Details
- Modular design with separate functions for each header category
- Optimized for low overhead
- Configurable options for all headers
- Default secure configuration out-of-the-box

### 3. Customization Options
- Enable/disable specific headers
- Configure HSTS parameters (max-age, includeSubdomains, preload)
- Set custom CSP policies
- Configure frame options (DENY, SAMEORIGIN, ALLOW-FROM)

## Example Implementation

An example application demonstrating both JWT authentication and secure headers middleware is included in `examples/auth-and-security`. The example showcases:

1. User authentication with JWT
2. Protected routes using JWT middleware
3. Role-based access control
4. Implementation of secure headers
5. Testing endpoint security

## Usage Guidelines

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - Always use strong, random secret keys for token signing
   - Keep token expiration times reasonably short (e.g., 24 hours)
   - Store tokens securely on the client side
   - Consider using refresh tokens for better user experience

2. **Secure Headers**
   - Start with the default configuration and adjust as needed
   - Consider enabling Content-Security-Policy with appropriate directives
   - For production applications, enable HSTS with reasonable max-age
   - Regularly review and update your security headers configuration

## Future Enhancements

1. **JWT Package**
   - Support for asymmetric key pairs (RS256, ES256)
   - Token blacklisting and revocation
   - Claims validation helpers

2. **Secure Headers**
   - Presets for different security levels
   - CSP nonce generation for inline scripts
   - Report-Only mode for CSP testing
