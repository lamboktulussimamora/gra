# GRA Framework Documentation - Search Enhancements Implementation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the enhancements made to the search functionality for the GRA Framework documentation. The improvements focus on delivering a more robust and user-friendly search experience, including features like search term highlighting, keyword extraction, version-aware search, and improved search result display.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Search Index Generator Improvements

The search index generator (`scripts/generate_search_index.js`) has been enhanced with the following features:

- **Advanced Keyword Extraction**:
  - Improved extraction of Go method names, function definitions, and code examples
  - Added recognition of Go package names and common framework terms
  - Enhanced extraction of struct and interface names
  - Added contextual keywords based on document location
  
- **Metadata and Content Structure**:
  - Added version information to search index
  - Enhanced content processing for better snippet extraction
  - Added document section headings for context

- **Configuration Options**:
  - Command-line arguments for customization (`--output-file`, `--exclude`, `--verbose`)
  - Improved content preprocessing for better indexing

### 2. Frontend Search Enhancements

The client-side search implementation has been enhanced with:

- **Search Result Display Improvements**:
  - Added snippet extraction with contextual relevance
