# GRA Framework Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy and areas of focus for the GRA framework.

## Testing Philosophy

The GRA framework aims to maintain high test coverage (>90%) across all packages to ensure reliability and stability. 

## Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

All packages should have comprehensive unit tests that:
- Test public APIs thoroughly
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Test edge cases
- Verify all functionality works as expected

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests should verify:
- Middleware chains work correctly
- Routing works as expected
- Request/response cycle functions properly
- Different components work together

### 3. Performance Tests

Performance tests should verify:
- Framework has minimal overhead
- Response times are acceptable under load
- Memory usage is efficient

## Areas for Improvement

### High Priority:
- **Logger Package**: 
  - Add tests for `Fatal` and `Fatalf` methods using mock exit function
  - Test all log levels consistently

- **Validator Package**: 
  - Improve coverage of edge cases and validation combinations
  - Add tests for unexpected input types
  - Test validation of nested struct arrays

- **Router Package**:
  - Improve tests for route conflicts
  - Test complex path parameter combinations

### Medium Priority:
- Add benchmark tests for performance-critical paths
- Add tests for concurrent request handling
- Add more examples and test them

### Low Priority:
- Add fuzzing tests for input validation
- Add load tests for high-concurrency scenarios

## Testing Guidelines

1. Always add tests for new features
2. Fix failing tests before adding new functionality
3. Maintain test coverage above 90%
4. Run tests before committing changes
5. Keep tests fast and independent

## Test Coverage Targets

| Package    | Current | Target |
|------------|---------|--------|
| gra        | 100.0%  | 100%   |
| adapter    | 100.0%  | 100%   |
| middleware | 100.0%  | 100%   |
| router     | 95.7%   | 98%    |
| context    | 90.0%   | 95%    |
| logger     | 87.9%   | 95%    |
| validator  | 82.6%   | 90%    |
